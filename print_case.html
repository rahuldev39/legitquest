                  <ol>
                    <li>  <p>These Appeals arise from a batch of interlocutory orders of the Allahabad High Court in a criminal writ petition (1786 of 2003). On 9 April 2003 a learned Single Judge of the High Court admitted a writ petition filed by the second and third respondents and stayed an order dated 7 December 2002 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, directing the registration of a case against them. The case was adjourned before the High Court on several dates on which it was listed. As a result of the adjournments, on the date of the institution of the Special Leave Petitions, the writ petition was pending in the High Court for six years.</p></li>
                    <li>
                      <p>This Court was concerned with the pendency of similar cases before the High Courts, where proceedings were stayed at the stage of the registration of an FIR, investigation, framing of charges or during trial, in exercise of the power conferred by Article 226 of the Constitution or Sections 397/482 of Code of Criminal Procedure,1973. Hence this Court, by an order dated 8 January 2010 called for reports from the Registrars General of the High Courts, in regard to serious cases involving: (i) murder; (ii) rape; (iii) kidnapping; and (iv) dacoity. On the basis of the data received, reports were presented to the Court by the amicus curiae. These reports were considered in an order dated 1 February 2012 by a Bench of two learned Judges, including one of us (the learned Chief Justice of India). In the order of this Court dated 1 February 2012 the findings in the second report submitted by the amicus curiae were summarized thus:</p>

                      <ol>
                        <li>“As high as 9% of the cases have completed more than twenty years since</li>
                        <li>the date of stay order;</li>
                        <li>Roughly 21% of the cases have completed more than ten years;</li>
                        <li>Average pendency per case (counted from the date of stay order till</li>
                        <li>July 26, 2010) works out to be around 7.4 years;</li>
                        <li>Charge-sheet was found to be the most prominent stage where the cases were stayed with almost 32% of the cases falling under this category. The next two prominent stages are found to be “appearance” and “summons”, with each comprising 19% of the total number of cases”.</li>
                      </ol>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p> During the course of the hearing of these proceedings, the Union Government has been impleaded as a party to the proceedings having regard to the fact that seminal issues are involved directly impacting upon the administration of justice. This Court has assumed jurisdiction since the long delays in the disposal of cases, particularly criminal cases, has a serious impact both on the rule of law and on access to justice which is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>In 1958, the fourteenth Report of the Law Commission of India on the Reform of Judicial Administration dealt with the issue of delay and arrears and identified inadequate judge strength as the “root cause” of the problem. This perspective has been reiterated in several successive reports, including of the Law Commission. These include the 77th Report of the Law Commission of India on “Delay and arrears in trial courts”, November, 1978 (Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India); 78th Report of the Law Commission of India on “Congestion of under trial prisoners in jails”, February, 1979 (Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India); 79th Report of the Law Commission of India on “Delay and Arrears in High Courts and other Appellate Courts”, May, 1979 (Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India); 121st Report of the Law Commission of India (method of review of judge strength at regular intervals), 1987; 124th Report of the Law Commission of India – The High Court Arrears – A fresh look, 1988; Report of The Arrears Committee (Three Chief Justices Committee : Kerala, Calcutta & Madras), 1989-90. </p>
      </li>
                  <li>  <p>The 120th Report of the Law Commission on Manpower Planning in the Judiciary (1987) suggested a formula for the fixation of judge strength, adopting a demographic approach. The Report suggested that demographics should be the basis for fixation of judge strength. Its rationale was set out thus :</p>

                    <small> <i>“As to the possible accusation that the working out of the ratio of Judges strength per million of Indian population is a gross measure, the Commission wishes to say that this is one clear criterion of manpower planning. If legislative representation can be worked out, as pointed out earlier, on the basis of population and if other services of the State – bureaucracy, police etc. – can also be similarly planned, there is no reason at all for the non-extension of this principle to the judicial services. It must also be frankly stated that while population may be a demographic unit, it is also a democratic unit. In other words, we are talking of citizens with democratic rights including right to access to justice which it is the duty of the State to provide.”</i> </small></li>
                    <li><p>The Report indicated that though the US in 1981 had one-third of India’s population, it had a judge to population ratio of one hundred seven judges per million, while in India it was only ten judges per million. The Law Commission suggested that the judge to population ratio be immediately increased from ten judges to fifty judges per million. The Report suggested that by 2000 India should achieve a target of one hundred and seven judges per million (which the US had in 1981).</p></li>
                    <li>
                      <p>If these recommendations had been acted upon India would have judge strength of 1,10,071 in 2000 (with the population of 1028 million) and 1,36,794 as on 31 December 2015. However, the sanctioned strength of the judiciary at all levels on 31 December 2015 was only 21,607.</p></li>

                    <li>
                      <p>This Court in a judgment delivered on 21 March 2002 in All India Judges Association v. Union of India[1] endorsed the views of the Law Commission in its 120th Report and directed that a judge to population ratio of fifty judges per million be achieved within a period of five years and not later than ten years in any case. This Court observed :</p>
                      <small> <i>“The increase in the Judge strength to 50 Judges per 10 lakh people should be effected and implemented with the filling up of the posts in phased manner to be determined and directed by the Union Ministry of Law, but this process should be completed and the increased vacancies and posts filled within a period of five years from oday. Perhaps increasing the Judge strength by 10 per 10 lakh people every year could be one of the methods which may be adopted thereby completing the first stage within five years before embarking on further increase if necessary”.</i> </small>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>9. The Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Arrears in Courts (2002) supported the application of the demographic norm as the starting point for determination of judge strength. In a letter dated 2 April 2013, the then Prime Minister of India also accepted the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India to double the existing number of courts. When this issue was taken up at the Joint Conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices in 2013 it was resolved to create new posts of judicial officers with requisite staff and infrastructure.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>In order to address the issue of arrears, a policy decision was taken by the Union government to constitute fast track courts and funds were allocated under the Eleventh Finance Commission for a period of five years (2000-05). When the issue of the discontinuation of fast-track courts came up, this Court in Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of India[2] held that the policies of the State should not derogate from undermining judicial independence and if a policy was counter-productive or liable to increase the case load, the court intervene judicially. Though this Court desisted from interfering with the policy decision in regard to discontinuing fast track courts, keeping in mind the huge pendency of cases, a direction was issued for the creation of additional posts in the district judiciary to the extent of ten per cent of the total regular cadre within a stipulated period.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>In a recent Report prepared by the Centre for Research and Planning of the Supreme Court of India titled “Subordinate Courts of India : A Report on Access to Justice 2016” a detailed analysis has been made of the pendency of cases in the district judiciary. The following table which has been compiled in the Report shows the figures of institution, disposal and pendency in the district judiciary for 2013-15:</p>

                      <h5>Where,</h5>
                      <h5>BEJ= Additional No. of Judges required to Break Even.</h5>
                      <h5>AI= Average Institution</h5>
                      <h5>ARD= Average Rate of Disposal</h5>
                      <h5>D2010, D2011, D2012 = Annual Disposal for that year</h5>
                      <h5>J2010, J2011, J2012 = Annual Working Strength of Judges for that year</h5>
                      <h5>J= Current Working Strength of Judges</h5>
                      <h5>The formula for determining the Number of Judges for disposing of Backlog required to dispose of pending cases within a given time period is:</h5>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>The Law Commission has noted that in the past, it was suggested that judges required to dispose of the backlog are needed only until the backlog is cleared. Hence, it was proposed that short-term, ad-hoc appointments should be made from amongst retired judges for clearing the backlog. However, the previous experience of the functioning of ad hoc appointments in the district judiciary reflected serious concern especially of the lack of accountability in their functioning and performance. Moreover, additional infrastructure would be required to be created even for ad-hoc judges appointed in the system. The proposal to have a shift system has been resisted by the Bar since it results in an increase in the working hours.</p>

                      <p>The note submitted by Professor Dr G Mohan Gopal raises certain concerns about the rate of disposal method suggested by the Law Commission. These concerns as set out in the note submitted by him, are summarized below:</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The definition of backlog (difference between institution and disposal) does not take into account the fact that every case requires a reasonable period for its disposal based on the nature of the dispute involved in that case. Under the above definition, even cases which have been filed towards the end of a year must be disposed of by 31 December to eliminate the backlog. In the absence of established time frames in our system for disposal of cases the elimination of a backlog is virtually unimplementable since it is impossible for courts to dispose of cases filed days or weeks before the end of a specified reference period;</p>
                        <p>The rate of disposal method unintentionally incentivizes lower disposals because lower the rate of disposal, the greater the number of additional judicial positions which that court will get under this methodology. The method proposed by the Law Commission is (according to the critique) not designed to improve productivity nor does it concern itself with judge to
              case ratio;</p>
