              <p>
              After we set foot in the third millennium AD, science and technology have advanced at an unfathomable rate. Unquestionably, this advancement has affected every sector that man came into contact with, including the legal sector. The days when hefty paperwork and time taking procedures clogged up the pipeline for legal justice are slowly becoming passé. After the introduction of cloud computing, the time durations and procedures are changing like never before. Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and concepts like <a href="https://www.legitquest.com/">online legal research</a> and e-courts are now becoming a present reality as opposed to when these were perhaps visions of the distant future. </p>

              <h4>Inception of Artificial Intelligence in Legal Sector</h4>

              <p>
                  Legal sector is the latest outpost for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tear down. Termed as one of the least technologically progressive sectors, the legal field, dominated by copious paperwork, is now beginning to embrace AI. AI does not change the nature of legal work. Instead, it assists by automating tasks such as due diligence, document drafting and performing legal research. Artificial Intelligence might be a breakthrough in law and it works by the application of sample data to a cognitively enabled system that can then analyse large amounts of data and deliver quite an accurate outcome. However, there seems no way that AI could replace judges and adjudicators as judicial decisions rely on legal reasoning and draw on the judge’s empathy and humanity and an innate common sense when it comes to dispensing justice. AI’s integration into the legal services is majorly for identifying patterns in cases that can lead to speedy outcomes.
            </p>

                <h4>Artificial Intelligence in Indian Legal Sector</h4>

              <p>
                  There is still a significant emphasis on human intervention and processes since the Indian legal profession draws heavily from tradition. So, what necessitates the bringing in of AI in the legal sector here? Greater transparency, price predictability and accurate analytics of work done will largely benefit law firms and could make AI the new normal. There is also a need to offer value-added services to clients and hence compete with global law firms which will necessitate the shift to AI. The onset of AI globally was also in parts to meet the demands of tech-savvy, sophisticated clients.
              </p>

              <a href="http://www.ecourts.gov.in/"><h3>E-Courts in India</h3></a>

              <p>
                The e-Courts project was gestated based on the <em>National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of information and communication technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary–2005</em> which was submitted by the e-Committee (Supreme Court of India). The vision was to transform the Indian Judiciary by ICT enablement of Courts. Hence, the e-Court project aims to provide ICT enablement of courts to make justice delivery system affordable and cost-effective. The e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project (Phase-I) is one such national e-Governance project being implemented in High Courts and district/subordinate Courts of the Country. </p>



             <p>
                The Phase-II of the Project was approved by the e-Committee of <a href="https://www.legitquest.com/">Supreme Court of India</a> in January 2014 for further enhancement of ICT enablement of Courts with its broad objectives being the computerization of as many as 8000 new courts and other legal authorities.
             <p>
                It also aimed at connecting the Courts in the country to the National Judicial Data Grid through WAN and through redundant connectivity to enable integration with the proposed interoperable criminal justice system. Citizen centric facilities such as centralised filing centres and touch screen based kiosks to be based at each Court complex, were also introduced.
            </p>

            <h4>Impact on Legal Services</h4>

            <img src="..\wp-content\themes\images\blog25jan_3.png" alt="">

            <p>
                An increasing amount of legal information has resulted in lawyers having to sift through astronomical amounts of data and all this research is, in turn, paid for by someone. No wonder legal costs are quite high throughout the world. At the same time, any change in the industry that reduces the number of billable hours will inevitably find resistance from professionals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Such technology that reduces the number of hours of human work required to resolve a case is highly likely to lead to job losses. Lawyers with broader skills or willingness to engage with the technology though will be benefitted. As of now, <a href="https://www.legitquest.com/">legal research</a> is mostly based around keyword search which means sorting through volumes of data to find keywords that are identified as relevant to a particular matter or case. </p>

            <p>
                New developments in AI by teams developing new legal technologies such as “ROSS” that are based on cognitive computing have expanded the possibilities. “ROSS” has been introduced as the world’s first artificially intelligent attorney. Essentially, programmers have taught computers to understand the principles of law. This new technology is accessed using natural language, making it easier for lawyers to use without any specialist training.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike other e-discovery technology used in the legal profession, “ROSS” does not depend quite so much on the right keywords being input but is instead able to answer legal queries using natural language. Thus, it acts much like a human lawyer being asked a technical question and giving advice and legal insight using its own knowledge and experience. The system also happens to be self-improving which is to say it can take feedback and use it to improve its performance.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Technology to overpower Human Intelligence?
            </h4>

            <img src="..\wp-content\themes\images\blog25jan_4.jpg" alt="">

            <p>Despite recent advances, human intelligence is still irreplaceable. Right now most of the technology in use by the legal sector is only capable of efficiently carrying out the burdensome research element of legal practice. Human lawyers are still indispensable when it comes to the construction of arguments, interaction with clients and judges, and drafting of policies.</p>

            <p>
                But there is also some change in these areas of legal work. Software to help draft contracts, conduct <a href="https://www.legitquest.com/">legal research</a> or to manage the workflow, is now well established in the industry. New technology such as “MarginMatrix” is also reducing the amount of time it takes to draft documents such as legal agreements and meet compliance obligations by checking the requirements in different jurisdictions.</p>

            <p>
                It goes without saying that lawyers need to adapt their working practices to accommodate these tools if they are to remain competitive against outsourced services. It is thought that blockchain technology, a kind of public ledger that records all transactions between two parties, is also likely to impact the legal industry in the long term.</p>
            <p>With some jurisdictions already starting to use blockchain to manage these legal matters, the legal profession needs to be prepared for this if it is to avoid becoming obsolete. Very junior lawyers previously handled the legal heavy lifting that is now being partially replaced by technology, and these relatively inexperienced professionals are likely to be most affected by adoption of technolog

              <p>
                  New lawyers spend around a third of their time conducting legal research which presumably means that fewer legal graduates need to be employed by law firms and practices. This is bound to impact employment in the profession, particularly of new graduates, at least in the short term. It also means the number of lawyers getting promoted to senior and experienced roles would drastically reduce. A study by Deloitte predicted technology resulting in over 100,000 job losses in the legal sector. That is bad news for law graduates, but arguably the changes are good for businesses and individuals seeking affordable legal advice. It is likely that some of the new technology could help reduce costs, a saving which will hopefully be passed on to clients.
              </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, it is quite possible that increased efficiency of law offices and the time spent working on a particular case being reduced will then lead to a higher intake of cases which will inevitably mean higher requirement of legal professionals in these offices. Hence, adoption of technology might actually increase jobs and even the quality of such jobs, as lawyers would no longer be required to do basic legal research and other tasks of clerical nature.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence technology can help lawyers change the way they do their work. It can improve work ethics. But replacing human beings is unimaginable at the moment as also ill-advised. That said, the role that Artificial Intelligence is capable of playing, not to replace human workforce, but to make tasks easier cannot be denied.</p>
